# hello-world

Hi World!
Hello Github, I'm happy to use this website, and I hope to learn a liitle things from this.

Here I would try the basic usage of Markdown:

1.强调(加粗、斜体、删除)，引用
>This is my ***first*** time to use github, hope I could begin a happy and exciting tour!
>>~~second reference~~

2.无序列表
- one
- two
- three

3.有序列表
1. A
2. B
3. C
4. D

4.包围的代码 

`code`
``double code``
```python
    triple code
```
